* Use masked arrays for the implementation of NaN-allowed morphology.

* Add tests:
    * Very simple behaviour (1-d images, bi-valued, non-bivalued).
    * Check equal result with pixel-wise implementation.

* Fix examples:
    * Fix plots.
    * Fix behaviour of inpaint/contrast mapping.
    * Test TH.

* Upload to Pip.
